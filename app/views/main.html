  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    Your clinician will sign you up to Buddy. That evening you will get a text from Buddy asking how your day was. Simply reply to the text and write about what you did and how you felt that day. You'll then rate the day with a number from 1 to 5, this comes in really handy when you look back at your entries.

  <p>
    Over the next week Buddy will text you every day and by replying you'll begin to build your mood diary. At any point you can login to Buddyapp.com and see all your diary entries.

  <p>
    Before the next session with your clinician, Buddy will ask you to fill our a Session Plan. Here you can plan what you would like to talk about and review the week. Buddy also sends you appointment reminders, so you'll always be prepared.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your clinician also has access to your Buddy diary, they will check it just before your next session and may use it during the session. By using Buddy your clinician will get a better understanding of your life between appointments which means together you'll be able to spot patterns and make connections between your mood and activity.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of your therapy session you can use Buddy to set goals for the coming weeks and even set text reminders to help motivate and remind you of the little things that will help in your recovery. So that's Buddy, a digital mood diary which enhances therapy sessions and supports your recovery. If you've already been signed up to Buddy you can login to see your diary entries.
